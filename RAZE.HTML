                    <span>Raze's playstyle is very aggressive compared to many of the other agents in VALORANT, as most of her abilities are focused on mobility and damage instead of intel gathering or support. She is one of the few agents where most of her abilities are primarily meant to deal damage, namely Paint Shells and Showstopper, and has commonly been criticized by the community for said abilities</span>
